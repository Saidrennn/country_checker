# Country Classification App 🇹🇷🌍

This is a beginner-friendly country classification app written in Python.

It allows the user to:
- Search which continent a country belongs to
- Add a new country to the continent list
- Delete a country from the list
- View the final list

## 🧠 Technologies
- Python (Basic syntax, lists, input/output)

## 📋 Features
- Takes user input for a country and checks if it's in Europe or Asia
- Allows users to add their own country and classify it
- Allows users to remove a country from the list
- Shows the final updated list

## 👨‍💻 Created by Me!
This project was fully written by me as part of my Python learning journey.  
I'm currently learning the fundamentals of Python and building small projects to improve.

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Use dictionaries instead of multiple lists
- Turn repetitive code into functions
- Add file saving with `.txt` or `.json`
- Add graphical user interface (GUI)

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed on your machine
2. Run the code with:

```bash
